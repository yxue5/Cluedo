Danny, Yang, Sai

we agreed to meet later this week as a group and really make progress
we have struggled with planning up to this point but im hoping to make more progress and figure out what we are acutally going to do at somepoint this week
i think that we will do alot of pair programming because of conflicting schedules
ill do alot of thinking about the project and come up with a solid plan for what we are going to do
